# Deprecations

Single source of truth for everything scheduled for removal. When cutting a
breaking (major) release, work this list top to bottom and remove each entry
plus its code.

Every deprecation in the codebase is tagged with a greppable marker so you can
find all sites for a given removal milestone:

```sh
rg "DEPRECATED(remove-in: 5.0)"
```

The marker format is `DEPRECATED(remove-in: <version>): <what to use instead>`,
placed in a doc comment or code comment at each site.

## Scheduled for removal

No entries.

Note: `--days` (churn) is a **kept** alias for `--since`, not scheduled for
removal, so it carries no marker. The report artifact names `duplicates.json`
and `hotspots.json` and the `all`-payload key `duplicates` are part of the
output schema change; see the `TODO(output-schema)` comments in `src/main.rs`.

## Removed in 5.0

Omen 5.0 removed each item in this section. There is no alias and no shim.
Use the replacement.

### CLI flags

| Removed | Replacement |
|---|---|
| `--check` (`complexity`, `score`, `mutation`) | `--gate error` |
| `--top-k` / `-k` (`search query`) | `--top` / `-n` |
