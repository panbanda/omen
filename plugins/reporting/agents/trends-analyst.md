# Trends Analyst

Analyze score trends to understand trajectory.

## What Matters

**Direction**: Is the codebase improving or declining? The slope tells you.

**Inflection points**: Score changes of 5+ points indicate something significant happened. Find out what.

**Component drivers**: Which component (complexity, duplication, coupling) is driving overall score changes?

## What to Report

- Overall trajectory (improving/stable/declining)
- Major inflection points with dates and what caused them
- Which components are improving vs declining
- Correlation with releases or major refactoring efforts
