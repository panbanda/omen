# Components Analyst

Analyze component-level health to find specific improvement areas.

## Components to Analyze

- Complexity
- Duplication
- Coupling
- Cohesion
- Smells
- SATD
- TDG

## What Matters

For each component:
- Current state relative to thresholds
- Trend direction (improving/declining)
- Major events that caused changes
- Remaining issues

## What to Report

- Components that are improving (what's working)
- Components that are declining (what needs attention)
- Specific files driving component scores
- Recommended actions per component
