# Custom providers define tree-sitter queries for proprietary feature flag systems.
# Each custom provider needs:
#   - name: Provider identifier (used in --provider flag)
#   - languages: List of languages this query applies to (go, ruby, python, javascript, etc.)
#   - query: Tree-sitter query pattern with @flag_key capture for the flag identifier
#
# Example: Custom provider for a Ruby Feature class wrapping Flipper/PostHog
# [[feature_flags.custom_providers]]
# name = "feature"
# languages = ["ruby"]

# (call
#   receiver: (constant) @receiver
